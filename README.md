# piscine_php
#### This is my PHP piscine @ 42 Paris
The "piscine" consists of two hard-working weeks, week-end included, with daily exercises grouped as "DayXX".
Throughout these Days, we will see different kinds of web-related notions.
The Rushes are team-based (groups of 2; partners chosen randomly) projects during the week-end.
